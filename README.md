# Blow-4-Blow


## Using JavaScript to build a browser-based attack simulator game.


#

## I wanted a good refresher app that I used to: 
 * communicate with the game player by using JavaScript functions.
 * Assign and manipulate data using JavaScript variables and operators.
 * Control the flow of the application by managing conditional statements.
